		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<img id="profilepic" src="assets/images/profile.jpeg" alt="Gurnam Sunny">

				<p>	I dived into the tech world in 2013 with no experience or skills and only passion. My Passion is to build things or create stuff that are beyond my imagination and creativity level. While creating my first company, I made many mistakes which made me a better leader and innovator. Everything we do in our lives gives us a great experience. While building my first company, I got to travel so many places and met many people with different passion and background with amazing stories. </p>

				<p>I already have been designing apps and website and now I want to learn more about the backend and coding world. One of the hardest things is to transfer your vision into someone else’s mind. I would like to design and write code for own my apps so I can create most things on my own.
